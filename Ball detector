A problem that our bot faced was that the kicker sometimes used to get triggered even though the ball was not in front of the bot within kicking range. It takes 3 sec to charge the capacitor and hence can be very critical in certain scenarios in the game. Therefore, as an effort to remove this problem we used an IR LED pair to detect the ball`s distance from the bot. We successfully implemented it and are now waiting for the mechanical team to guide us towards the positioning of the sensors based on which we can take further action.
