The kicker we use works on the principle of a solenoid.
The straight kicker is powered by two 250V 2200uF capacitors, which can be charged by a step-up converter to 200V each.
The kicker board constitutes of a charging and a discharging circuit. The FPGA on the main circuit is controlling the circuit. The board receives charge trigger and kicking level from the main circuit, charging the capacitor bank of 4400uF to 250V using flyback topology.
The charging circuit is based on LT3750, a flyback converter. It consists of a different resistor which can be used to change various output parameters like charging current. The CHARGE pin one the IC gives full control of the LT3750 to the user and the DONE pin indicates when the capacitor has reached its programmed value, and the part has stopped charging.
The capacitor is charged to its limit by using a boost convertor that steps up the voltage from the the 12V battery. The kicker is operated through a switch which disconnects the charging circuit and allows the charge from the capacitor to flow through the solenoid. 
As the kicker is made of a magnetic material as soon as the current flows the coil tries to bring as much of the kicker inside itself as possible. This is what generates the tremendous kicking force required to kick the ball.
